# Documentation Protocol

## 1. Permitted Files Only
Update only the existing structure. **NEVER** create new `.md` files without explicit confirmation.
- **Main Entry:** @README.md (Quick start, tech stack, API overview)
- **Architecture:** @docs/ARCHITECTURE.md (DB schema, auth flow, service layers)
- **Service Layer:** @docs/SERVICE_LAYER.md (Business logic rules, usage, function reference)
- **Operations:** @docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md (Common issues, install/run fixes)
- **Database:** @docs/MIGRATIONS.md (Alembic workflow, migration history)

## 2. Content Standards
- **Simple English:** Write clearly and concisely to minimize token usage.
- **No Redundancy:** Check existing content before writing. Do not duplicate information across files.
- **No Summaries:** Do not create separate "summary" or "checklist" files.
- **Reference Code:** Mention file paths (e.g., `services/auth.py`) instead of copying large code blocks into markdown.

## 3. Workflow
- If a new document is absolutely necessary, ask for user confirmation first.
