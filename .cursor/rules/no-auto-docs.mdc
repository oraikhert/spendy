# Global Restriction: No Auto-Docs

- **DO NOT** create, modify, or suggest any documentation files (`*.md`) during feature implementation or debugging [1, 3].
- **DO NOT** generate `IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `SETUP_CHECKLIST.md`, or similar files [4].
- Focus exclusively on code changes. 
- Ignore all documentation-related tasks unless the user explicitly asks for them in a separate request.
