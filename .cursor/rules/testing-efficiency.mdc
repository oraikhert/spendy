# Testing Standards & Token Efficiency

## 1. Minimalist Testing Policy
To minimize token consumption, follow these criteria:
- **Core Only:** Create tests **ONLY** for critical business logic or complex functions.
- **Skip Simple Logic:** Do not create tests for trivial functions, basic getters/setters, or simple utility methods.
- **Manual Confirmation:** If unsure whether a test is necessary, ask the user before creating it.

## 2. No Standalone Tests
- **Prohibited:** Never create "standalone" test scripts that duplicate project logic or run in isolation.
- **Requirement:** Always import functions, classes, and methods from the existing codebase (e.g., `from app.services import ...`).
- **Integration:** Tests must rely on the project's established environment and dependencies.

## 3. Organization & Location
- **Directory:** All test files **MUST** be stored in the `@tests/` directory.
- **Naming:** Follow standard naming conventions (e.g., `test_*.py`) to ensure compatibility with `pytest`.

## 4. Token Optimization
- **Brevity:** Keep test code concise. Focus on the "happy path" and critical edge cases only.
- **Reference:** Instead of copying large data structures into tests, reference existing constants or use minimal mock data.
- **Cleanup:** Do not generate verbose comments or redundant docstrings within test files.
